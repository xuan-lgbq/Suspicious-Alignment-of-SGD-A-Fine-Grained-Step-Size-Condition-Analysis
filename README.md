# Suspicious-Alignment-of-SGD-A-Fine-Grained-Step-Size-Condition-Analysis
This project investigates the alignment of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with the dominant subspaces. 
quad_sim. py provides tools to simulate SGD dynamics and visualize the transition between the decay phase and the steady state for the quadratic case.
